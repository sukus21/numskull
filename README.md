# The Numskull programming language
 An esoteric programming language where numbers are mutable

## What is this?
 This project exists for 3 reasons:
 - I wanted to learn GO
 - I wanted to make my own programming language
 - Useless programming languages are fascinating
 
 I've been toying with the idea of a programming language where numbers are mutable for a while, and finally decided to spend a weekend designing it and making an interpreter for it. The interpreter has since been updated, improving both code readability and execution speed. The original version was a full text interpreter, but all never versions compile programs to a bytecode before executing them, improving program speed dramatically.

## Documentation
 - Anything you could possibly want to know about the language should exist within the [Language Specification](/LANGUAGE.md).
 - The interpreter is command line based and has a built in `--help` argument, but I still went ahead and wrote [Interpreter Usage](/USAGE.md)
