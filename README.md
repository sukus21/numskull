 An esoteric programming language where numbers are mutable

### What is this?
 This project exists for 3 reasons:
 I wanted to learn GO,
 I always wanted to make my own programming language,
 And esoteric languages are cool.
 
 I've been toying with the idea of a programming language where numbers are mutable for a while, and finally decided to spend a weekend designing it and making an interpreter for it. Since i only spent a weekend on it, the interpreter has some weird code, and syntax checking won't always work out. That is what updates are for, I guess.

 Anything you could want to know about the language should exist within
